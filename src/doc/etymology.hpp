@page about_hutznohmd What on earth is a Hutznohmd?

A Hutznohmd (or Hutzenabend in standard german) is a tradition of the people of
the Ore Mountains (german Erzgebirge, czech Krušné hory). The Ore Mountains were
populated during the medieval times, because silver and other ores were
discovered there. During the 16th century the Ore Mountains were the heart of
the mining industry in central europe.

In the 17th century economical crisis and especially the Thirty-Years-War
disrupted the mining boom in the Ore Mountains. The population had to find other
occupations. The textile industry and the industry of producing wooden goods and
toys arose out of this. Knipling became increasingly popular. Due to the harsh
climate, to save firewood and because of companion, the women began to work
together in one room. This was the birth of the Hutznstube.

Slowly the Hutzenstube got filled with tradition. The men often joined their
wives after work. They started carving, smoked pipe, talked and sang together.
The Hutzenabend was born. Later artists wrote songs about this tradition.
Nowadays the Hutzenabend gets more and more an event including dinner and music.

@section sec_etymology Etymology

The word Abend (Ohmd or Obnd in the dialect of the western Ore Mountains) is the
german word for the evening.

The word hutzen (a german weak verb) is a bit complicated, because it is not
used as verb anymore and nowadays all existing sources seem to conflict each
other. In the dialect of the Ore Mountains (as in Vogtland and Fraconia) it was
used to say: "to meet people by strolling to them".
